# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
      # Answer: 
          i. Timely Delivery ensures that managers, colleagues and clients can all accomplish their objectives on time.
          ii. It ensures clients expectations are met.
          iii. It provides competitive advantage when products/softrware are delivered on time.
          iv. It improves effective communication.
          v. It mitigates risks by preventing costs overruns, schedule delays and resources additional expenses.

         To ensure software are delivered on time, Project Managers:
           i. Set clear deliverables (set project's goals and objectives, with a set of tasks and activities to be met with everyone on board).
           ii. Set a realistic deadline.
           iii. Involve team members and stakeholders.
           iv. Utilize a time management tool e.g Scrum, Gantt charts etc.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
      # Answer:
           Agile methodology is an iterative & incremental approach in software development life cycle, while Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential apporach in software developmemt life cycyle.
            
           #Agile Methodology Is:
            i. An iterative and incremental approach.
            ii. It focuses on flexibility, collaboration and adaptability in software development life cycle (SDLC).
            iii. It fully involves the end-users and stakeholders during software development in almost/all phases of the project.
            iv. It is unpredictable, hence the adaptability feature helps mitigate risks.
            v. It involves high degree risks and uncertainty.

          #Waterfall Methodology Is:
            i. A linear and sequential approach.
            ii. Each phase must be fully completed before advancing to the next phase (not flexible).
            iii. Each phase is dependent on the output of the previous phase.
            iv It does not involve the end-users in all phases except during the initial stage (requirement analysis).
            v. It is predictable and involves planned steps.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
      # Answer:
      Agile methodology is more suited for smaller projects with less complexity, but waterfall methodology is more suited for large and complex projects especially enterprise-type softwares/projects.
      For example, Agile is utilized for projects like: product design projects, software development projects, personal milestones projects (birthday events, wedding ceremonies etc.)
      While waterfall is utilized for projects like: construction type projects, manufacturing projects, healthcare projects, SDLC projects (like new mobile application from scratch).

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
      # Answer:
      Methods To Ensure Quality Assurance in a software Project:
            i. Define the scope and goals of your software.
            ii. Plan the quality assurance activities.
            iii. Implement the quaality assurance process.
            iv. Evaluate the quality assurance outcomes.
            v. Improve the quality assurance process.
      High Standards: 
            i Enhances customer's satisfaction.
            ii. It ensures consistency.
            iii. It ensures regulatory compliance.
            iv. It protects brand value and reputation.
            v. It improves operational efficiency.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
      # Answer:
        Project Scope Management Is Importanct As:
            i. It ensures that a project is delivered on time, within budget, and meets the stakeholders' needs and expectations.
            ii. It ensures all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the boundaries of the project.
            iii. It helps envision the entire lifecycle of your project and make sure your end goals are achievable.

        A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a tool that can be used for projects, programs, and even initiatives to understand the work that has to be done to successfully produce a deliverable(s). It takes a large project and, quite literally, breaks it down into smaller components.

            i. It makes it easier for teams to identify scope, cost and deliverables.
            ii. It delegate tasks to the team members who are best suited for the job.
            iii. It provides a tool for team brainstorming and collaboration.
            iv. It provides a proven and repeatable approach to planning projects.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
      # Answer:
          Project Schedule:
            i. It helps project managers plan and track the timeline of the project.
            ii. It helps communicate the project timeline to all stakeholders.
            iii. It can help prevent the project from going over budget.
            iv. It can help ensure that the project is completed on time.
          
            a) Gantt charts are useful for planning and scheduling projects.
            b) They help you assess how long a project should take, determine the resources needed, and plan the order in which you'll complete tasks.
            c) They are also helpful for managing the dependencies between tasks.
            d) Gantt charts help teams to plan work around deadlines and properly allocate resources.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
      # Answer:
      The telemedicine software aims to address issues such as:
          a) Innovation of AI into healthcare sector in developing countries like Nigeria and its benefits.
          b) Enable patients and healthcare providers send and receive medical data.
          c) Provide a user-friendly interface and satisfactory experience.
        
      Major challenges/barriers to address are: money/funds, adoption and awareness, regulations (of the country and health sector), technology infrastructure etc.
      
      ##Medication is important for everyone. The target audience is not limited to age, race, country etc. But, it's important to create awareness to ensure the adoption of the software, take consideration of technology infrasturcture of the country together with their healthcare regulations, considerations of affordability of the healthcare services etc.
  
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
      # Answer:
          Before you can solve a problem, you need to understand it clearly and completely. This means defining the scope, goals, constraints, and assumptions of the problem, as well as identifying the stakeholders, users, and requirements of the system.
          
          Problem Identification and definition:
            a) Ensures An Opportunity to Gather Relevant Facts.
            b) Gives Space to Methodically Identify Root Causes and Develop Action Plans.
            c) Gives An Opportunity to Develop Holistic Solutions.
